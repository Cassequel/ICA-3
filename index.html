<!-- - Update page count. Create three pages, an index.html and two other .html files that you may name according to the content of your site. There should be proper navigation for all possible paths between the pages.
- Organize Files. Move all your images to an 'img' folder and CSS to a 'styles' folder. Update file paths in your HTML.
- Write Notes. Add a notes.txt file in the root folder. Write one paragraph each on your experience learning HTML, CSS, and Git thus far in the course.
- Set Up Git and GitHub. Initialize a Git repository and make at least 3 commits. Add a .gitignore file and exclude notes.txt. Push your project to a public GitHub repository. Host your site using GitHub Pages. -->
